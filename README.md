# BitsNBolts Emotionbot 

### What is the project about? 
The project is about making an installation for the event BitsNBolts. 
My project, the name is still a little unclear, the EmotionBot, is about turning an everyday machine against its user. 
This is simulated by the bot showing emotions and pretending it doesn't feel like doing things.
