# BitsNBolts Emotionbot 

## What is the project about? 
The project is about making an installation for the event BitsNBolts. 
My project, the name is still a little unclear, the EmotionBot, is about turning an everyday machine against its user. 
This is simulated by the bot showing emotions and pretending it doesn't feel like doing things. 

### Set-Up   
In this Exampel i use brew to downdload phyton but you do you (you just have to google what the terninal-commands are for your Package-Manager.)
```$ brew install python```
```$ pip3 install.... (not clear at the moment)```

### SSH Connection 
If you don't know how to create an SSH connection yet, check this out:

Connect to Raspi using: 
```$ ssh oliver@10.0.15.87``` or 
```$ ssh oliver@lucid-raspi.local```
I recommend using the connection over the IP, because the other one takes atleast 2 minutes to connect.
(The option with the IP connects instant)
User and Passwort in 1Password.
